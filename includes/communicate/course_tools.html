    Generally speaking, rubrics help instructors to communicate to students the
    metric on which their work will be evaluated and consequently rubrics help
    students to better understand where to focus their time, attention, and 
    effort. The rubric tool in Blackboard organizes evaluation criteria for an
    assignment into a grid of columns and rows. The rows correspond to the 
    various criteria for an assignment. The columns correspond to the level of
    achievement for each criterion. A description and point value for each cell
    in the rubric define the evaluation and score of an assignment.<br/>
