  <h1>Set Up Groups</h1>

  <p>
    Instructors are able to set up groups in Blackboard to support 
    collaboration. Depending on your preferences, users can be enrolled in 
    groups manually, randomly, or through self-enrollment.
  </p>

  <h2 id="set_up_groups/create">Create a Group</h2>

  <p> 
    Instructors can create Group pages for a single group or for a group set
    and can then link to group pages from within course content pages. From a 
    content area in the course, click on the &quot;Add Interactive Tool&quot; 
    button and select &quot;Groups.&quot; (Alternatively, you can follow a 
    similar creation process by navigating to the &quot;Control Panel, 
    selecting &quot;Users and Groups,&quot; and then selecting
    &quot;Groups.&quot;)
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Click on the &quot;Create Single Group button or &quot;Create Group
      Set&quot;, and select either &quot;Self-Enroll&quot; or &quot;Manual
      Enroll&quot;.<br/>

	   alt="Create Group Set Menu Screenshot" />
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <em>Self-Enroll</em> allows students to join the Group themselves 
	  by adding their name to a sign-up sheet. Sign-up sheets can be made 
	  available on the Groups page, and can limit the number of people 
	  allowed to join the Group. Self-Enrollment Groups can be made one 
	  at a time, or made in sets.
        </li>
        
	<li>
	  <em>Manual Enroll</em> allows the instructor to assign students 
	  to groups.
        </li>
        
	<li>
	  <em>Random Enroll</em> distributes students into Groups randomly
	  and based on the desired number of students per group, or the 
	  desired number of Groups. For example, if there are 24 students 
	  enrolled in a Course, and the Instructor wants four students per 
	  group, the system would create six Groups. If the Instructor wanted
	  four groups, the system would randomly enroll six students per Group.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Choose to make the group unavailable, available or sign-up sheet only.
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Instructors may click &quot;No&quot; for the group to be unavailable
	  in case the instructor needs to finish with the options before the
	  students can see it.
	</li>
        
	<li>
	  Clicking &quot;Yes&quot; will put up a sign-up sheet and students
	  will be enrolled when they sign up.
	</li>
	
        <li>
	  Selecting &quot;Sign-up Sheet Only&quot; will create a sign-up sheet
	  and the instructor will need to approve the groups before the
	  students are actually enrolled.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Click &quot;Submit&quot; to create group.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="set_up_groups/view_group_pages">View Group Pages</h2>
  
  <p>
    Once groups are created for users in a course, instructors can access the 
    group pages for every group in the course and students can access the group
    pages for the groups they are in.

      Go to the Control Panel, Users and Groups, and then select Groups.
    </li>

      tools and assignments.
