  <h1>Instructor Questions</h1>

  <p>
    These are some of the common questions that instructors transitioning from
    Blackboard 8 to Blackboard 9.1 have asked.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="old_course">Where is my old course?</h2>

  <p>
    Many instructors have logged into Blackboard 9.1 expecting to see their
    full list of courses from previous semesters. As part of the upgrade
    process, prior Blackboard 8 courses were not automatically moved to the
    Blackboard 9.1 server.
  </p>

  <p>
    To retrieve old course content, available options are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Request that content from an old Blackboard 8 course be copied over to
      a new Blackboard 9.1 course as preparation to deliver it to students in
      the upcoming semester.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Ask that an old Blackboard 8 course be moved to the Blackboard 9.1
      server as a reference.<br/>
      <em>Note:</em> Future students will not become enrolled in this type
      of course, it is strictly for instructor reference.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="content_differences">Why does some of the course content appear
    different?</h2>

  <p>
    Instructors may need to make adjustments to previous course content that
    was copied into a new course, e.g. changing the course menu, formatting
    cleanup.
  </p>

  <h2 id="retrieve_dropbox">Where are the Dropbox files?</h2>

  <p>
    The Digital Dropbox does not exist in Blackboard 9.1, though Blackboard,
    Inc. created a utility to access old files. Some information, including
    timestamp and file names, is not accessible. Instructors may contact
    Blackboard Support for assistance with retrieving Dropbox files.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you used the Dropbox in Blackboard 8 and still need this functionality,
    there are two options:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use the <a href="../evaluate#assignments">Assignments feature</a>, which is
      Blackboard's alternative to the Dropbox.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Schedule a one-on-one with us to discuss your needs and other possible
      options.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="tool_movement">Where did Blackboard put that thing I need?</h2>
  
  <p>
    Blackboard Support is here to help instructors become oriented to 
    Blackboard's new user interface. Instructors can receive or participate in
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Scheduled Blackboard 9.1 demonstrations</li>
    <li>Small-group workshops</li>
    <li>One-on-one consultations</li>
    <li>Support for the online Blackboard documentation found here</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Office of Technology for Education is happy to help in a way best
    suited to the instructor, but it's better not wait to the last minute for
    support.
