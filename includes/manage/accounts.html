  <h3>General Guidelines for Sponsored Account Use</h3>
  
  <p>
    Account holders/users (owners) and their sponsors are held responsible for
    the correct use of the sponsored account. Sponsored accounts are not to be
    used for commercial purposes and should serve educational and university
    purposes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Use of the sponsored account must comply with the
      <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/guideline/index.html">
	internet guidelines and ethical standards</a>
      of Carnegie Mellon and comply with the intent of the sponsorship as 
      stated by the account sponsor.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      All questions or changes related to the account must be referred to 
      the account sponsor (a senior staff or faculty person, or a
      departmental account administrator).
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Cooperation is expected from both sponsors and sponsored accounts 
      holders in any official resource management activities led by
      Computing Services that may require cooperative participation.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      The account must be used in a reasonably secure manner. This includes
      using recommended authentication methods and
      <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/doc/accounts/passwords/index.html">
