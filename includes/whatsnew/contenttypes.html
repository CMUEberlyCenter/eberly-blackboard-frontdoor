  <h1>New Content Types</h1>

  <h2>Syllabus</h2>

  <p>
    Blackboard's &quot;Syllabus&quot; is essentially a template that
    instructors can use to structure, present, and modify their syllabus in a
    Blackboard course.<br/>

  <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>

  <p>
    A Lesson Plan is a special content type that combines information about
    the lesson itself with the curriculum resources used to teach it. The
    default lesson plan sections include the instructional level, grade level,
    objectives, and subject area of the lesson. Additional sections can be
    added to the Lesson Plan, arranged to display in any order and optionally
    displayed to students.<br/>

  <h2>Module Page</h2>
  
  <p>
    Blackboard provides several informational and web application resources
    (modules) that can be added to a Module Page. Module Pages
    present/organize these information sources and web applications in
    discrete boxes or modules. Instructors can select and arrange modules on a
    Module Page for students to access. Currently the available modules
    include: Alerts, Calculator, Dictionary, Announcements, Calendar, Tasks,
    Report Card, Textpad, Thesaurus, To Do.<br/>
